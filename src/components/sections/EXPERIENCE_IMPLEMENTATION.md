### Accessibility Features

#### ✅ Semantic HTML
- Proper use of `<section>`, `<article>`, `<time>` elements
- Heading hierarchy (h2 for section, h3 for positions, h4 for subsections)

- Each experience entry has descriptive `aria-label`
- Links have descriptive labels for screen readers

#### ✅ Keyboard Navigation
- All interactive elements (links) are keyboard accessible
- Focus states with ring indicators
- Proper tab order

#### ✅ Screen Reader Support
- Semantic structure for easy navigation
- Descriptive labels for all content
- Role attributes where appropriate (`role="list"`, `role="article"`)

### Responsive Design

#### Mobile (< 640px)
- Single column layout
- Smaller timeline markers (12x12)
- Stacked content
- Smaller text sizes
- Touch-friendly spacing

#### Tablet (640px - 1024px)
- Medium-sized timeline markers (14x14)
- Improved spacing
- Larger text

#### Desktop (> 1024px)
- Larger timeline markers (14x14)
- Optimal spacing and typography
- Company logos at 16x16
- Enhanced hover effects

### Testing

#### ✅ Unit Tests (`Experience.test.tsx`)
- 20 comprehensive test cases
- All tests passing
- Coverage includes:
  - Component rendering
  - Data display (all fields)
  - Chronological ordering
  - Conditional rendering (logos, projects)
  - Accessibility attributes
  - Edge cases (empty data, minimal data)
  - Date formatting
  - Link functionality

### Requirements Mapping

| Requirement | Status | Implementation |
|------------|--------|----------------|
| 2.1 - Display chronological list | ✅ | Automatic sorting by end date |
| 2.2 - Show company, position, dates, description | ✅ | All fields displayed with proper formatting |
| 2.3 - Display responsibilities and achievements | ✅ | Separate sections with visual indicators |
| 2.4 - Order most recent to oldest | ✅ | Sorting algorithm handles "Present" and dates |
| 4.3 - Link to related work projects | ✅ | Anchor links with project IDs |

### Files Created

1. `src/components/sections/Experience.tsx` - Main component
2. `src/components/sections/Experience.test.tsx` - Unit tests (20 tests)
3. `src/components/sections/Experience.demo.tsx` - Demo/preview component
4. Updated `src/components/sections/index.ts` - Export added

### Data Integration

- Reads from `src/data/experience.json`
- Uses TypeScript interfaces from `src/types/index.ts`
- Fully typed with no `any` types
- Handles optional fields gracefully

### Performance Considerations

- Uses Next.js Image component for optimized image loading
- Efficient sorting algorithm
- No unnecessary re-renders
- Lazy loading for images
- Minimal bundle size impact

## Usage Example

```tsx
import { Experience } from '@/components/sections';
import experienceData from '@/data/experience.json';

function Page() {
  return <Experience experiences={experienceData} />;
}
```

## Next Steps

The Experience section is complete and ready for integration into the main page. The next task in the implementation plan is:

**Task 10: Implement Skills section**

# Work Projects Section Implementation

## Overview
The Work Projects section displays professional projects completed during work experience, showcasing real-world business solutions and technical accomplishments.

## Components Created

### 1. WorkProjects.tsx
Main section component that displays a grid of work project cards.

**Features:**
- Responsive grid layout (1 column mobile, 2 columns tablet, 3 columns desktop)
- Fetches data from `workProjects.json` and `experience.json`
- Maps experience IDs to company names for display
- Optional callback for navigating to associated experience
- Proper ARIA attributes for accessibility
- Empty state handling

**Props:**
- `onViewExperience?: (experienceId: string) => void` - Optional callback when user clicks to view associated experience

### 2. ProjectCard.tsx (UI Component)
Reusable card component for displaying individual work projects.

**Features:**
- Project image with lazy loading
- Project title and company name
- Description text
- Technology tags with pill styling
- Action buttons for demo, code, and experience links
- External links open in new tabs with security attributes
- Hover effects and transitions
- Full-height flex layout for consistent card heights

**Props:**
- `project: WorkProject` - Project data object
- `experienceCompany?: string` - Company name from associated experience
- `onViewExperience?: (experienceId: string) => void` - Optional callback for experience navigation

## Data Structure

### WorkProject Interface
```typescript
interface WorkProject {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  longDescription: string;
  technologies: string[];
  companyId: string;
  experienceId: string;
  images: string[];
  demoUrl?: string;
  repoUrl?: string;
  featured: boolean;
  startDate: string;
  endDate?: string;
}
```

## Styling Approach

### Responsive Grid
- Mobile (< 768px): 1 column
- Tablet (768px - 1024px): 2 columns
- Desktop (> 1024px): 3 columns
- Gap spacing: 1.5rem (6) on mobile/tablet, 2rem (8) on desktop

### Technology Tags
- Blue color scheme (`bg-blue-100`, `text-blue-800`)
- Pill-shaped with rounded-full
- Small text size with medium font weight
- Flex wrap for multiple rows

### Action Buttons
- Demo button: Primary blue styling
- Code button: Gray secondary styling
- Experience button: Light blue accent styling
- All buttons have focus rings and hover states
- Icons from Heroicons (inline SVG)

## Accessibility Features

1. **Semantic HTML**
   - `<section>` with proper `id` and `aria-labelledby`
   - Heading hierarchy (h2 for section, h3 for project titles)

2. **ARIA Labels**
   - Links have descriptive `aria-label` attributes
   - Icons marked with `aria-hidden="true"`

3. **Keyboard Navigation**
   - All interactive elements are keyboard accessible
   - Focus indicators on all buttons and links

4. **Screen Reader Support**
   - Descriptive alt text for images
   - Proper link text and labels
